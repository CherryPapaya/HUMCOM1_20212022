            We've all heard of them. Pugs are one of the cutest companions a person can have. They are energetic,
            charming, and adorable. Unlike most dogs, the Pug actually hasn't changed that much since ancient times.
            And their history shows why the Pug invokes a feeling of royalty to whomever has been graced by their presence.

                <h2><a id= "Definition">What is a Pug?</a></h2>
                <p>The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, 
                    short-muzzled face and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of 
                    colors, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles.

                <h2><a id= "History">History</a></h2>
                <p>The roots of the Pug date back to 400BC in China. China bred Pugs with wrinkles purposefully
                    in the hopes of making the wrinkles look like the Chinese character for "<i>Prince</i>" which is "<strong>Áéã</strong>".
                    As such, the Pugs were associated with royalty and were meant to be royal companions.<br>

                <h2><a id= "Health Issues">Health Issues</a></h2>
                <p>Due to centuries of inbreeding, Pugs have developed some distinctive health issues. 
                    Their pushed-in face can cause them difficulty breathing, and they have a particularly
                    hard time keeping cool in hot weather. Pugs can be susceptible to mange, and their 
                    bulging eyes are prone to getting scratched. In fact, it is recommended that Pugs 
                    do not share homes with cats, due to the increased risk of injuring their eyes.
